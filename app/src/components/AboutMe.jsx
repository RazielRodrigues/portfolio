                <p className="mt-4 text-gray-500 sm:text-xl">
                    I've been passionate about technology from a young age, inspired by my father, who was a programmer. This curiosity led me to study databases at FATEC Bauru, where I discovered my path in web development. Since then, I've dedicated myself to learning and improving daily, starting with my first opportunity working with PHP and web technologies.

                    I’m deeply grateful to the mentors who shaped my professional journey. As developers, we play a key role in today’s tech-driven world, so I approach every line of code with responsibility and a commitment to excellence, knowing the impact it has on users and customers.
